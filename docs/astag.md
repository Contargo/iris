#ASTAG

Geocoding in Swiss behaves different then in other countries. In Swiss only static addresses are used to find addresses. The reason for this is [ASTAG](http://www.astag.ch/).

They define the distances in Swiss. So if you want to use IRIS in Swiss you have to use the static addresses and route data revisions defined by ASTAG.
